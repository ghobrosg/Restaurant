# Restaurant

In this program, the user first choose the sandwhich he wants among the different choices each with different prices. Then he chooses his side, with 4 choices that are all priced differently. Finally he chooses his drink. Then, based on his choices, the program will add up the total cost of all his choices, which is the subtotal. Then, it will multiply the subtotal by 0.13, to find how much the customer needs to pay in taxes. Finally, the subtotal is multiplied by 1.13 and that is the total value the customer owes.
